Text-based Black Jack Game

Installation: 

1 Clone the project or download the zip file and unzip it into a folder of your choice.

2 Open a terminal and go the dirctory of the project where the pom.xml resides

3  type mvn package

4  java -cp target/blackjack-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ca.ubc.ece.azarei.insightdata.App

Please note that depending on the MVN installation this might not work at the first try. An easier way is to import the project into eclipse or your IDE as an existing Maven project.

Please let me know if you need any assistance to get this project running!

If you are using Mac OS X Mavericks in order to install Maven you need to unizp the latest version of Maven in a folder of your choice and then add the bin directory to your path. You can add a directory to your path by creating a text file in "/etc/paths.d/" and put the address of your directory in the file. 

Thanks!
